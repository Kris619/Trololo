# Trololo
I'm building this while learning from [Lazy Foo' Productions' SDL Tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/). 

## About
Trololo is written in C++ with SDL 1.2.12 (32 bit) with the SDL extension library: SDL_image (1.2.12).

## License
This software is released under the GNU General Public License Version 3. Please read the LICENSE file to know your rights before continuing. 

## Support
* Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit (Service Pack 1) (g++ 4.7.0)

## Current State
This software doesn't do much yet. Nothing is guaranteed to compile but most of the time it should. Binary links will be added in future stable updates on the [latest readme on github](https://github.com/Kris619/Trololo/).
